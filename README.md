## Spring Boot and Thymeleaf responsive HTML Covid-19 Visualizer

This is a practice web project, implemented with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. It visualizes data from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). This is part of my effort to study how the Spring Boot applications works.
